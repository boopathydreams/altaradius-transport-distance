# Deletion Functionality Test Guide

## Overview
The deletion functionality has been implemented with cascade deletion and confirmation dialogs. This guide helps you test it safely.

## Features Implemented
✅ **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting a source or destination automatically deletes all related distances
✅ **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows the item name and impact count before deletion
✅ **Enhanced UI**: Delete buttons with trash icons and proper styling
✅ **Detailed Feedback**: Success messages show exact deletion counts
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed deletions

## How to Test

### 1. Navigate to Manage Data
- Go to http://localhost:3000/app
- Click on the "Manage Data" tab

### 2. Test Source Deletion
- Find a source in the Sources section
- Click the red trash icon next to it
- You'll see a confirmation dialog showing:
  - The source name
  - Number of related distances that will be deleted
- Click "Delete" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
- After deletion, you'll see a success message with exact counts

### 3. Test Destination Deletion
- Find a destination in the Destinations section
- Click the red trash icon next to it
- Same confirmation process as sources
- Success message shows deletion counts

### 4. Verify Cascade Deletion
- Before deleting, note the total distance count in the statistics
- After deletion, refresh and check that the distance count decreased accordingly

## Safety Features
- **Double Confirmation**: You must click the delete button AND confirm in the dialog
- **Clear Impact Warning**: Dialog shows exactly what will be deleted
- **No Accidental Deletion**: All delete actions require explicit confirmation
- **Detailed Feedback**: Success messages confirm what was actually deleted

## API Endpoints
- `DELETE /api/sources/[id]` - Delete a source and related distances
- `DELETE /api/destinations/[id]` - Delete a destination and related distances

## Testing Recommendations
1. Start with a source/destination that has few related distances
2. Test both canceling and confirming deletions
3. Verify that the statistics update correctly after deletion
4. Test deletion of items with many related distances to see the impact count

## Notes
- Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone
- The system will prevent deletion if authentication fails
- All related distances are automatically deleted due to database constraints
- The UI updates immediately after successful deletion
